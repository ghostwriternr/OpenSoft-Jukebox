"you get plant leaves, wrap them in paper, light it on fire and suck on it" which is normally a sentence-but not today because I'm setting out on the quest for a long sentence-that I'm typing up which reminds me of a story my grandpa told me about himself when he was "your age"-about how they covered the letters of the type writers and they had to type so-that they could memorize where the letters are on a type writer and my-grandpa says-he will never regret taking that class because it helped him out a lot when-it came to typing and now a days he is not bad a typing at all because He is almost-as fast as me because I am a pretty fast typer and writing this article isn't-taking very long and expect being pretty far pretty soon at-the pace I'm going right now so there are going to-be some serious records getting busted when I'm finally finished writing this article on-this dumb website which will probably end up huffing this article even though-it is fun-packed and joyful and keeps the reader reading when they use that excuse-mom saying "just one more sentence" but that sentence is 10,000 words long and still continuing to go at a reasonable pace
